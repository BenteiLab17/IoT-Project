<h2>This repository contains three sections.</h2>
<ul> 
  <li>Arduino codes (WeMosD1) which reads the sensors data and transmit them to the database (Google Firebase)</li>
  <li>ML jupyter notebook codes containing a model which is trained using Random Forest. The dataset is taken from Kaggle ('Water Potability.csv')</li>
  <li>Android codes (Java) which fetches water parameters data from "Google Firebase" and predicts whether the water is safe or not</li>
</ul>
